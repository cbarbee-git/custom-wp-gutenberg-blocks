# WP Custom Gutenberg Blocks

Gutenberg Custom Blocks are created using React within a custom<br />
And included calls from a Theme's functions.php file, by using the ACF - Pro plugin.

## Description

Here I have created a custom 'Toaster' block, and a 'Testimonial' block with ACF. This code is meant to live within
the 'wp-content' folder of a WordPress installation. It includes theme functions needed to accommodate the ACF plugin
functions for setup and display in editor and front-end.

## Getting Started

I have also included Custom Post Type UI plugin. This allows a user to create a custom post type. The reason it is
included here, is to allow a user to select a filter to only display blocks conditionally within the editor. If a user
only wants a block for a specific post type, they can set those filters in the ACF settings

### Dependencies

* WordPress
* Advanced Custom Fields - PRO
